# skills

A set of AI skills I regularly use.

Tracking policy:

- This repo uses an allowlist `.gitignore`; only skills explicitly un-ignored are tracked
- To add a tracked skill, create a real directory here and update `.gitignore` to unignore it (for example, add `!new-skill/` and `!new-skill/**`)
- Local, symlinked skills are expected and remain ignored unless explicitly allowed
