# skills

A set of AI skills I regularly use.

By default, this folder uses an allowlist-style `.gitignore` so we can drop in symlinked skills locally without polluting the repo. To add a new tracked skill, create a real directory here and update `.gitignore` to unignore it (for example, add `!new-skill/` and `!new-skill/**`). This keeps the repository clean while still allowing local, symlink-based workflows.
